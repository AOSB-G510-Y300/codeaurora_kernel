* Qualcomm MSM VPU

Required properties:
- compatible : one of:
    - "qcom,vpu"
- reg : Specify offset and length of the device register sets.
- reg-names : Names corresponding to the defined register sets.
    - "maple_csr_reg" : Maple CSR registers
    - "maple_smem_reg" : Maple shared memory registers
- interrupts : Specify the vpu interrupts.
- interrupt-names : Names corresponding to the defined interrupts list.
    - "maple_wdog_irq" : Watch dog interrupt
    - "maple_apps_irq" " Maple to Host interrupt

- qcom,maple-clk-load-freq-tbl: Table of <load, freq> entries. An entry
  specifies a given VPU processing load (in bits per second), and a
  corresponding clock frequency (in Hz) to set. Entries should be in ascending
  order of load, and their number is variable. For maple clock.
- qcom,vdp-clk-load-freq-tbl: Same as above, for vdp clock.
- qcom,bus-clk-load-freq-tbl: Same as above, for bus clock.
- qcom,bus-load-vector-tbl: Vectors of <load, ab, ib>. The (ab,ib) pairs are
  ddr bus bandwidths to be requested at corresponding video processing load.
  Vectors should be in ascending order of load, and their number is variable.
- qcom,enabled-iommu-maps: list of IOMMU map names that should be enabled.
    - "vpu_nonsecure" : Non-secure video data IOMMU
    - "vpu_secure" : Secure video data IOMMU
    - "vpu_firmware" : Maple Firmware loading IOMMU
- vdd-supply: regulator that supplies vpu.
