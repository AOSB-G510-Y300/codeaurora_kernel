Palmas RTC controller bindings

Required properties:
- compatible:
  - "ti,palmas-rtc" for palma series of the RTC controller
- interrupt-parent: Parent interrupt device, must be handle of palmas node.
- interrupts: Interrupt number of RTC submodule on device.

Optional properties:
- ti,back-battery-charge-enable: The palmas series device like TPS65913 or
	TPS80036 supports the battery backup for powering the RTC when main
	battery is removed or in very low power state. This flag will enable
	the backup battery charging.
- ti,back-battery-charge-low-current: Configure lower charging current. Device
	supports the charging current as < 100mA or >100mA. Low current will
	set as <100mA.

Example:
	palmas: tps65913@58 {
		...
		palmas_rtc: rtc {
			compatible = "ti,palmas-rtc";
			interrupt-parent = <&palmas>;
			interrupts = <8 0>;
			ti,back-battery-charge-enable;
			ti,back-battery-charge-low-current;
		};
		...
	};
